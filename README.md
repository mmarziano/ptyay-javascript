# README

P.T.YAY is a simple web application built on the Ruby on Rails framework and geared towards parents and PTA users. This application allows admin users to create fundraising campaigns and parents to RSVP and view fundraising events for their children.  

Usage: To access the app, please clone the repo, cd into the ptyay-rails directory, run bundle install, 'rake db:migrate' and 'rake db:seed', and run 'rails s' to fire up the server.

Please note that "Signin with Google" will not work due to a missing Client_id once the repo is cloned.    

Bug Reporting: All comments and bug reports welcome (mmarziano1@gmail.com).
